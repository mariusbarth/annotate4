Title: S4 Classes and Methods for Annotated Vectors
Version: 0.1
Description: annotate4 is experimental code that was aimed at providing S4 classes
  for basic R data types that additionally had meta-data (like variable labels).
  However, base R has a lot of non-generic functions that get confused by these
  new objects.
